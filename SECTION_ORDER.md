# Home Page - Optimal Section Order

## Current Issues:
- Stats section is at the bottom (should be near top)
- Online Presence section is too far down
- Flow could be more logical

## Recommended Order:

1. **Hero Slider** ✓ (Current position: 1)
2. **Quick Info Bar** ✓ (Current position: 2)
3. **About Section** ✓ (Current position: 3)
4. **Stats Section** ❌ (Current position: 14 - MOVE UP)
5. **Products Section** ✓ (Current position: 4)
6. **Why Choose Us** ✓ (Current position: 5)
7. **Industries Section** ✓ (Current position: 6)
8. **Quality & Certifications** ✓ (Current position: 10)
9. **Our Approach** ✓ (Current position: 7)
10. **Applications Section** ✓ (Current position: 8)
11. **Service Areas** ✓ (Current position: 11)
12. **Client Testimonial** ✓ (Current position: 9)
13. **Online Presence** ❌ (Current position: 15 - MOVE UP)
14. **FAQ Section** ✓ (Current position: 12)
15. **Contact CTA** ✓ (Current position: 16)

## Changes Needed:
1. Move "Stats Section" from position 14 to position 4 (right after About)
2. Move "Online Presence" from position 15 to position 13 (before FAQ)
3. Move "Quality & Certifications" from position 10 to position 8
